# Tekton Pipelines Tutorial

This tutorial uses a simple `Hello World` example to show you how to:
- Create a `Task`
- Create a `Pipeline` containing your `Tasks`
- Use a `TaskRun` to instantiate and execute a `Task` outside of a `Pipeline`
- Use a `PipelineRun` to instantiate and run a `Pipeline` containing your `Tasks`

This tutorial consists of the following sections:

- [Creating and running a `Task`](#creating-and-running-a-task)
- [Creating and running a `Pipeline`](#creating-and-running-a-pipeline)

**Note:** Items requiring configuration are marked with the `#configure` annotation.
This includes Docker registries, log output locations, and other configuration items
specific to a given cloud computing service.
